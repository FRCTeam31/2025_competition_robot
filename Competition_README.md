# At Competition
In order to reduce number of people in and around our pit, only one squad can work on the robot at a time. To help make sure everyone feels involved in the competition, we will rotate squads in and out of the pit as needed to give team members the opportunity to enjoy every aspect of our competitions.

### Active Squad Rotation:
- Driver Laptop
	- One laptop is designated as the *driver laptop* for the competition, and each squad will use this laptop for code fixes. 
	- There will also be a backup laptop designated in case the driver laptop goes down for any reason.
- **Pit Lead**
	- The squad lead acts as the "pit lead" and designates who is responsible for performing  code fixes (this *can* be themselves if they choose). Squads without leads can decide together who performs a fix. 
		- **NOTE:** ***No arguing*** - If a person is selected as the designee, do **not** argue with the decision.
- **Stay Vigilant**
	- Squad rotation will be signaled via Discord channel #dev-comp-rotations
	- Your squad could be called on at any moment to fix a problem, so keep an eye on your Discord notifications in case your squad is activated.

### Inactive Squad Activities
Squads who are not currently active can choose from a selection of other activities to stay involved in competition. Even if you're not actively working on coding the robot, we want students to stay engaged and be active participants in the competition. 
1. **Participate in Scouting**
	- Due to the size of our team, scouting may be an assigned schedule, so we will do our best to account for this. 
2. **Team Programming Liason**
	- One squad at a time can choose to visit other teams and offer programming assistance. 
	- If a team needs programming assistance, and the squad does not feel comfortable/confident helping, ask other team members or a coach for assistance.
		- **NOTE:** *Don't worsen the problem* - don't be afraid to tell a team "*I don't want to make this worse, I need to ask for help.*" This is better than making their problem worse.
3. **Improve the codebase**
	- If there are areas of the code that could use improvement, find a place to sit down and work on it.
		- **NOTE:** Do *not* modify critical robot code without first reviewing your changes with a coach.
4. **Watch our matches**
	- Whether from the stands, livestream, or from the pits, you *must* watch each one of our robots matches. 
	- The reason for this is that if there is a bug or defect during the match, you need to know the context of what happened in order to be prepared to solve the problem. 
	- Stay up to date with our match schedule via sites like TheBlueAlliance other scheduling apps.
5. **Cheer us on!**
	- *Team Spirit:* when watching from the arena, get loud!
6. **Stay positive:** 
	- If we have a rough match, be encouraging. 
	- Never disparage or insult another person, even if someone is on mechanical.
