## Project Tracking
The Programming team's work is tracked in [this GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/FRCTeam31/projects/2/views/1?pane=info), with one of the below statuses:
- _Planning_ - We're planning how we want to code this
- _Active_ - Coding is in progress
- _Awaiting Mech/Elec_ - Progress is blocked by a mechanical or electrical problem
- _Needs Testing_ - Initial code is complete and needs to be tested on the real robot.
- _Bugged_ - There is a bug in this code
- _In Review_ - This code needs to be reviewed by a coach
- _Done_ - This is code-complete, tested, and merged into the `main` branch

Items on this project board are created from [issues](https://github.com/FRCTeam31/2025_competition_robot/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/FRCTeam31/2025_competition_robot/pulls). When you create a new issue or a pull request, make sure to assign it the correct assignee(s), label(s), add it to the "2025 Competition Robot Build" Project, and add a status, size, and start date to the project item

## Code conventions
These rules apply to all code committed to this repository.
- Package names are always lowercase.
- `public` or `static` variables are named in `PascalCase`.
- `private` variables are prefixed with an underscore, and named in `_camelCase`.
- Any function with greater than 8 parameters must use a [DTO class](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dto-pattern) to wrap the parameters
    - These DTOs must be suffixed with `Parameters` and can be as simple or complex as needed.
- Use the lowest-resolution data type when possible to save memory. 
    - If a number will always have a value between -128 to 127, use a `byte`. 
    - If a number will always have a value between âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, use an `int`.
    - etc.
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
    - If a function or a variable does not **need** to be accessed from outside a class, do not make it `public`
- Document your code with JavaDoc comments for all `public` functions and variables. 
- Add comments to your code on the line right above any area that would require explanation. 

## Subsystem conventions
These rules apply to subsystems in the robot, unless otherwise approved by a coach.
- Subsystems must follow the IO pattern.
    - Must include an `IO` interface.
    - Must include an `IOReal` class, which inherits from the interface.
    - Must include an `IOSim` class, which inherits from the interface.
    - Must include an `IOInputs` class.
    - Must include an `IOOutputs` class.
- Subsystems must include a member `<Subsystem>Map` class, containing only `public static final` values.
    - Values in the `Map` are values which are recorded for configuration of the robot, and are changed _very_ rarely.
- Subsystems are located in the `subsystems` package, in their own package.

## Other Squads:
- Autonomous Squad - 3 members
	- This squad is responsible for creating PathPlanner autonomous routines, and integrating subsystem actions into those routines successfully. 
	- Each Subsystem Squad lead will nominate one member from their squad (it can be themselves) to be on the Autonomous Squad.
	- Members:
		- [TBD]
- Operator Interface Squad - 3 members
	- This squad is responsible for crafting the Driver and Operator command structures to create an intuitive interface between the driver controls and the robot's subsystems.  
	- Each Subsystem Squad lead will nominate one member from their squad (it *cannot* be themselves **or** their Autonomous representative) to be on the Operator Interface team.
	- Members:
		- [TBD]
